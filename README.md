Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains an R script and code book that can be used to "clean up" data taken from Samsung Galaxy S3 accelerometers.  The data, available on UCI's Machine Learning Repository, was collected by Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto at Smartlab, Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory in Genoa, Italy.

The R script combines "test" and "train" datasets along with appropriate labels, extracts mean and standard deviation measurements, and supplies a summary data table with average values for each measurement, subject, and activity.  The code book describes how each of these steps were carried out with help from the data.table and reshape2 packages.
